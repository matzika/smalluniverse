Simulation of a small universe in OpenGL

Creation of a 3D solar system. The program is constructed to support any type of solar system depending on user’s preferences. One can have multiple solar systems running, consisting of more than one suns with planets and moons moving around them. It can also support the creation of wormholes and asteroids. We chose to simulate our very own solar system to show the power of our implementation. However, the current code can easily be extended to simulate other universes with small modifications inside the main class.

The program simulates a sun and the 9 planets of the solar system. Revolution and rotation are employed as the basic movements in the program. Shaders are utilized to simulate the lighting and shading of the space objects based on the light emitted from the sun. Similarly, textures are added to the objects to simulate the objects’ surfaces. Planets orbits are drawn so that the viewer can have a better perspective of the solar system. In addition, asteroids appear occasionally, entering the system and being destroyed when they reach the sun.

The user can navigate around the solar system using the keyboard or the mouse.
